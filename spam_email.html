							<h1>Spam Email Identifier With Tensorflow</h1>

							<p>I am going to build a TensorFlow-based Spam detector, in simpler terms, we will have to classify the texts as Spam or Ham.</p>
                            <p>The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/akanksha496/spam-detection-using-tensorflow/input">Dataset</a> is made of Text Messages. But it is severely unbalanced, so I needed to do a Random Undersampling.</p>

                            <h2>Preparing the Data</h2>
							<p>I have converted "Ham" and "Spam" to binary variables. Tokenization is the process of converting text into numerical tokens. Each unique word in the text is assigned a unique integer, or ‘token’. This allows us to represent our text in a way that can be processed by a machine learning model. </p>
							<p>After tokenization, we often end up with sequences of different lengths, since sentences in natural language can vary in length. However, machine learning models usually require input of a fixed size. This is where padding comes in.Padding is the process of making all sequences the same length by adding '0’s at the end (or beginning) of shorter sequences.</p>

                            <h2>Training the Deep Neural Network </h2>

                            <p>The model built is a ‘Sequential’ model because it is a sequence of layers. It starts with an Embedding layer that transforms integer-encoded vocabulary into learned vectors, adding a dimension to the output. A GlobalAveragePooling1D layer follows, providing a fixed-length output vector by averaging over the sequence dimension. Next is a Dense layer with 32 units and a ‘relu’ activation function for non-linearity. A Dropout layer with a rate of 0.3 helps prevent overfitting. The final Dense layer uses a ‘sigmoid’ activation function for binary classification, outputting a scalar prediction indicating the probability of the positive class.</p>

							<p>The model achieved an accuracy of 95%, which is really good. It started overfitting after Epoch 10</p>
                            <h2>Predictions</h2>
							<p>I have done the predictions using the Youden Point, this is an optimal Threshold on a ROC curve that maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity, representing a balance between these two classification model performance metrics.</p>
