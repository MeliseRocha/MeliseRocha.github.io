							<h1>Unsupervised Machine Learning Models</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ellen-qin-fIMqGvVaATk-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning, where a Algorithm Patterns and structures in data detected without a target variable. I am going to especially talk about the clustering algorithms, when clustering, the algorithm groups data points based on similarities in their characteristics into clusters.</p>
                            <p>Today, I will show how to perform clustering on a dataset for Breast Cancer.</p>

                            <p>As a first step we collect basic information about the dataset. As shown below, all the columns are numerical data and there is no missing values. It is important to normalize the data.</p>

                            <h2>Stats</h2>
							<p>Correlation matrix of the dataset reveals that there are high correlation between variable pairs. Correlation between Radius, perimeter, and area variables are more than 0.98. Correlation between Compactness, concavity, and concave points variables are more that 0.83. Fractal Dimension is the only variable with negative correlation. </p>
							<p>In a scenario like that, it is a good idea to apply Principal Component Analysis. To identify the ideal number of components in a PCA we use the explained variance ratio. The ideal number of components is usually chosen as the smallest number for which the cumulative explained variance ratio exceeds a certain threshold, I chose 0.9.</p>

                            <h2>Clustering with KNN</h2>
                            <p>The Elbow Method is a technique used in determining the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. The point where the rate of decrease sharply shifts is the “elbow” and can be a good choice for k. In this case it is not clear if the best option is 2 or 3 clusters.</p>

							<h3>2 clusters</h3>
							<p>Separation can be observed only in PC1 dimension. Within sum of square of the cluster 1 is much than the cluster 0. The reason of this needs to be the difference between observation numbers of the clusters.There is no visible overlap between clusters.</p>
							<iframe src="unsupervised_learning/knn_2clusters.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
							<h3>3 clusters</h3>
							<p>With three clusters, there is no overlap between clusters. Separation can be observed both in PC1 and in PC2 dimensions. I have also shwon how to add the cluster labels to the original dataframe.</p>
